Android Projects done by July, 2015.

Monopoly Money: An app solution to using paper money for the game. 
The app connects players using bluetooth and handles the money transactions of the game.
The code works fine but could use some refactoring.

Whistle/Clap Detector: A simple Whistle/Clap detection app. Basic structure of the published app without the core algorithm.
None of the bells and whistles included.
